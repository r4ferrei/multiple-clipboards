Multiple Clipboards
===================

Have more than one simultaneous clipboard in Sublime Text 2
------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, I wish I had more than one clipboard simultaneously available to me.
This plugin solves this issue in ST2 by creating as many as 9 of them. Copy into
one of the clipboards, and paste its content when you need it. Supports multiple
selections by pasting into all the selected regions.

Usage
-----

There are 9 clipboards numbered from 1 to 9.
To copy into clipboard *i*, press ``Alt+C i``. To paste the contents of clipboard
*i*, press ``Alt+V i``. That is, the same as usual *copy/paste* shortcuts, where
the command key is replaced by ``Alt``. Note that the number is a separate
keystroke.

If you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, feel free to contact me.
